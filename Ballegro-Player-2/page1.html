<u><h1>FAQ</h1></u>
<u><h3>When should I ask my target audience for their preferred features?</h3></u>
<p>Ask multiple times in the process, starting with the beginning of the project. Your audience might have different needs or restrictions that you have not thought of.</p>
<u><h3>Can I create a few wireframes and have someone turn it into an app for me?</h3></u>
<p>No. You will need to conceive of the usable design, the backend coding and account for the whole user <em>experience</em> yourself or as a team.</p>
<u><h3>Can I spend a couple of minutes with a customer and have it count as design critique?</h3></u>
<p>No, you need to fully understand the user's context for using the app to ensure it is most effective. Plan to spend at least an hour with them using the app.<p>
<u><h3>What do I do when I have released a beta version of my app?</h3></u>
<p>Be ready to address system bugs as they occur from your users.</p>
