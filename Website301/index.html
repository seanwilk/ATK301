  <center><h1>About Me</h1></center>

  <h3><p>My name is Sean Wilkinson. I am 23 years old and a junior at Illinois State University. This website is an assignemnt for my web design class.</p>
  <p>My hobbies span all over the place, ranging from playing and listening to music, photography, playing tennis, to making jewelry, sound design, and live video for concerts.</p>
  <p>I began playing music in the fourth grade, starting with playing cello in the school orchestra. <br>I played cello until sophomore year of high school, when I switched to upright bass. Bass lead me to playing on the school jazz band, and i also played in my friend's rock band.</p><br>
  <p> I also play guitar, piano, ukulele, and a little bit of drums. Currently I am working on making electronic music. I am interested in pursuing sound design and foley work as a profession.</p>
